Description:

Potential users need to input the required data such as the expense name, amount, payment method, category, 
tags and date of when the expense was made. The application allows users to track their expenses daily, weekly, 
monthly, and yearly in terms of summary in bar graphs and pie-charts. This web-site is a detailed expense manager 
that will not only help users keep a check on their expenses and incomes, but also cut down the unrequired expenses, 
and thus will help provide a responsible lifestyle.
